- 👋 Hi, I’m @pirateamelia
- 👀 I’m interested in creating games that will bring sighted and blind people together.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning MOO programming ... again. I have the time now I didn't have a few years back to pursue it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... not sure, really. I can offer my ideas, or my creative writing skill, but I'm not skilled enough with code to help with that yet.
- 📫 How to reach me ... 
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've cared for many kinds of animals in my lifetime. Past pets include cats, a dog, a dove, a pair of donkeys, various reptiles, ferrets and a few more.
